# Glossary

**OO** object oriented programming. Collecting data structure and code to manipulate said data in an opaque interface.

**FP** functional programming. FP focuses more on functions as the core programming concept as opposed to opaque classes. Common algorithms take data as input with a callback function that can provide specialisation.

**Instantiation** allocating and initializing memory using a class described by the compiled code.

**Class** description of data structures and methods as defined by code that can be compiled and instantiated.

**Object** A piece of memory in a running application built from a class definition. Methods in the class are invoked blindly by the user and the method code runs in the binding context of the object.

**Mutable/immutable** Whether a code entity can change values in its binding context. Mutable objects can change their state and immutable objects cannot and must be copied/updated for every state change.
