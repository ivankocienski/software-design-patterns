# Delegate

A method of behaviour composition by passing interactions through a 'Parent' class to a 'Child' class. An example would be an user interface widget that delegates its geometry behaviour to a WidgetGeometry object.

## Sample Implementation

An user has a bank account object that tracks their finances. The User object delegates the bank account methods to its bank account object.
