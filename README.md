Design patterns are ways of implementing familiar solutions using an established set of concepts and procedures.

This repository is a collection of implementations of the common design patterns using Ruby.

Ruby was selected for its strong OO conventions. All code in this repository can be run by any basic ruby interpreter without any external dependencies.
